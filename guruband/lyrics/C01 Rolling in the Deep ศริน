Rolling in the Deep
Adele
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch,
it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out
and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it, to the beat
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
The scars of your love remind me of us
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it, to the beat
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
We could have had it all
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
We could have had it all
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
It all, it all, it all
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
We could have had it all
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
We could have had it all
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep
#M Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
#M You're gonna wish you never had met me
But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat.
